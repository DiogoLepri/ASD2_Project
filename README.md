# ASD-DiagNet: A Hybrid Learning Approach for Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using fMRI Data

This repository contains the implementation of **ASD-DiagNet**, a hybrid learning approach for detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The algorithm is based on the methodology presented in the research paper by Taban Eslami et al. (2019).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameter Configuration

Before running the notebook, please configure the following parameters in the first cell:

- **Atlas Name**: Select one of the following options: `"cc200"`, `"aal"`, or `"dosenbach160"`  
  *Example:*  
  ```python
  p_ROI = "cc200"
  ```

- **Number of Folds for Cross-Validation**: Integer value specifying the number of folds  
  *Example:*  
  ```python
  p_fold = 10
  ```

- **Classification Mode**: Specify `"whole"` or `"percenter"` for the desired classification strategy  
  *Example:*  
  ```python
  p_mode = "percenter"
  ```

- **Center Name**: Required only for per-center classification  
  *Example:*  
  ```python
  p_center = "Stanford"
  ```

- **Classification Method**: Choose one of the following: `"ASD-DiagNet"`, `"rf"`, or `"SVM"`  
  *Example:*  
  ```python
  p_Method = "ASD-DiagNet"
  ```

- **Data Augmentation**: Specify `True` or `False` to enable or disable data augmentation (applicable only for ASD-DiagNet)  
  *Example:*  
  ```python
  p_augmentation = False
  ```
